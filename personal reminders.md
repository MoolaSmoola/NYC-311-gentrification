# Personal reminders

## Shiny map
* separate between 0 & NA calls
* add markers for parks/houses of worship/etc.

## ACS data
* Comparison Profile a viable option
* population estimates should not be taken from ACS 5-year but rather the Census Population Estimates Program (PEP)
* 2020 nonresponse bias was [adjusted](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2022-03.html) in caclulating ACS 5-years that include 2020
* ACS 5-year includes estimates for [all population sizes](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html)
* Multi-year estimates [smooth out 1-year impacts like COVID](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2022/03/period-estimates-american-community-survey.html), included in time I of our data. Further reading needed.

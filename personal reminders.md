# Personal reminders

## Shiny map
* separate between 0 & NA calls
* add markers for parks/houses of worship/etc.

## ACS data
* Comparison Profile a viable option
* population estimates should not be taken from ACS 5-year but rather the Census Population Estimates Program (PEP)

## log

* created folder for app in main branch, leafletapp; app saved as app.R
* In order to run app: `runGitHub("NYC-311-gentrification", "MoolaSmoola", subdir = "leafletapp/")`
